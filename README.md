# Peteballs

A simple game written in vanilla JS with a canvas view

# Introduction

I work for a company and our administration application is called PETE. I wanted to add an easter egg for the operations users to play. So i made a primitive version of this game. So the game was called Peteballs. When i decided to make a better version with sprite-sheets rather than just primitive shapes I wanted to make it look like a 16bit game from the late 90's.

So this is a tutorial about making a simple game in vanilla javascript. You could use a JS gaming framework like [Phaser.io](http://phaser.io), but i wanted to write something end to end for a better understanding and because shut up.

# The game dynamic

So the game we're going to be making is a series of levels that generates a number of ball sprites at random locations with random directions. The user can trigger an explosion once per level and any balls that collide with the explosion will also explode. There's a minimum number of balls that must be destroyed to pass the level.

Here, have a play
